# EdgeDetection
Edge detection using C.
## Convolution Process:

* In image processing, convolution is a mathematical operation that is used to modify the intensity values of pixels in an image. It involves multiplying 
the intensity values of the pixels in the image by a set of coefficients, or "weights," and summing the results to produce a new intensity value for each pixel.

* Convolution is often used to apply various types of filters to an image, such as edge detection filters, blur filters, and sharpening filters. It is also used in
image compression, image recognition, and other applications.
